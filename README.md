# DeathSwap Minigame Plugin

This is a **Minecraft Spigot plugin** for the **DeathSwap** minigame, inspired by Dream's famous DeathSwap challenges. In this minigame, two players join, and every 15 minutes, their positions are swapped. The player need a strategy how to kill the other player when they swapped position each other. The game ends when one player dies, and the remaining player wins!
